# DeFi Manager

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has taken a huge part in the development of blockchains and their associated ecosytems since 2019. In 2021, DeFi decentralized applications (Dapps) are ubiquitous and represent a huge part of the overall transactions on any blockchain that allow their development. Some giants like **Uniswap** (Ethereum), **AAVE** (Ethereum and MATIC) or **PancakeSwap** (Binance Smart Chain) are active Dapps that everybody knows about when dealing with DeFi.

As this phenomenon continues to grow and innovate, it can be difficult to follow along the money that you could for example lend, borrow, add for liquidity or even stake on those Dapps and their various protocols. Thus, a DeFi management website that is safe, clear, user-friendly and easy to access seems to be well needed at the time we speak. 



#### Elrond Blockchain

Some products are already live for Ethereum, BSC, Matic and many other blockchains that have decentralized exchanges (DEX) already online. Nevertheless, Elrond is about to deliver its DEX, the Maiar Exchange, in the upcoming weeks, this exchange release will be the beginning of a huge wave of projects built on the Elrond blockchain, resulting in many highly interesting DeFi Dapps. 

The aim of our project is to deliver a complete DeFi Management tool that will focus on someone's DeFi portfolio exclusively on Elrond first. If you are a React JS developer and a blockchain enthusiastic, feel free to contact us.
